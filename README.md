# Xolotl

A dual oscillator, harmonic synthesizer.

The bars represent different stages in the oscillator.

The Min/Max controls set the pitch range, while the Step control sets the smoothing between pitches. 

2 Harmonic, sample based oscillators

Each "oscillator" consists of 16 independently pitched samples. By default the pitch increments through the harmonic series, but can be un-quantised using the step knob.. Massive stabs, thick 16 note chords, pretty tinkling bells and more.

Flexible 16 Stage Sample and Hold

32 oscillators need at least 16 sample and hold effects, right? maybe not under normal circumstances, but this one's a bit different. Depending on how itâ€™s configured, it can act as an effect, sound generator or modulator.

16 Stage Multimode Filter

A bunch of filters with independent control of the cutoff. There's a ton of sonic potential here. Comb filtering, phaser effects and some very tasty interaction between the S&H section.

Finally..

At the end of the signal chain is simple ADSR envelope and pan spread control.

Modulation

Xolotl has 2 looping envelopes, 2 polyphonic modulators, a single free running modulator, A S&H LFO, a tracking generator.

Sound Library

The basic version comes with 150 sounds recorded from vintage and modern synthesisers. The expanded version adds an additional 250 sounds from classic like the Oberheim Xpander, Roland System 100, Roland JX-3p and more.

Please note that Xolotl is under active development, it is not a finished product and there will be bugs :).
