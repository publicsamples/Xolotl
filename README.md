**2 Harmonic, sample based oscillators**

  

Each "oscillator" consists of 16 independently pitched samples. By default the pitch increments through the harmonic series, but can be un-quantised using the step knob.. Massive stabs, thick 16 note chords, pretty tinkling bells and

  

**Flexible 16 Stage Sample and Hold**

  

32 oscillators need at least 16 sample and hold effects, right? maybe not under normal circumstances, but this one's a bit different. Depending on how itâ€™s configured, it can act as an effect, sound generator or modulator.

  

**16 Stage Multimode Filter**

  

A bunch of filters with independent control of the cutoff. There's a ton of sonic potential here. Comb filtering, phaser effects and some very tasty interaction between the S&H section.

  

**Finally..**

  

At the end of the signal chain is simple ADSR envelope and pan spread control.

  

**Modulation**

  

Xolotl has 2 looping envelopes, 2 polyphonic modulators, a single free running modulator, A S&H LFO, a tracking generator.

  

**Sound Library**

  
The free version comes with 150 sounds recorded from vintage and modern synthesisers. An [expanded version](https://app.gumroad.com/products/rhnqwh/edit#) is available that adds an additional 250 sounds from classic like the Oberheim Xpander, Roland System 100, Roland JX-3p and more. Functionally both versions are identical.

Please note that Xolotl is under active development, it is not a finished product and there will be bugs :).
