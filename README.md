# Xolotl

Xolotl is an open source "harmonic" synthesiser built with [HISE](https://github.com/christophhart/HISE).  Plugins are available for Mac OS , Windows and Linux.

##Harmonic oscillator

The “oscillator" consists of up to 32 independently pitched waveforms. These can be standard synth waveforms, multi-samples (expanded version only) or single cycle waveforms  (expanded version only). By default the pitch increments through the harmonic series, but can be un-quantised using the step knob..

##Flexible 16 Stage Sample and Hold

32 waveforms need at least 32 sample and hold effects, right? maybe not under normal circumstances, but this one's a bit different. Depending on how it’s configured, it can act as an effect, sound generator or modulator. 

##32 Stage Multimode Filter

A bunch of filters with independent control of the cutoff. There's a ton of sonic potential here. Comb filtering, phaser effects and some very tasty interaction between the S&H section.

##Finally..

At the end of the signal chain is simple ADSR envelope and pan spread control.

##Modulation

Xolotl has 2 looping envelopes & 3 over-spec’d LFOs with mixable waveforms and unique waveshaper
